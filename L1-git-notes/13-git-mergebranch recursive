a recursive merge is when two branch or more have commit
fast-foward cannot be done
steps:
 1. git branch          // print all branch
 2. git checkout main
 3. git pull origin main
 4. git merge feature/branch-name


 example:
 main
 │
 ├── feature/A                      ← main branch for Feature A
 │   ├── feature/A/part-1           ← sub-task or test case A1
 │   └── feature/A/part-2           ← sub-task or test case A2
 │
 ├── feature/B                      ← main branch for Feature B
 │   └── feature/B/part-1           ← sub-task or bug fix B1
 │
 └── feature/C                      ← main branch for Feature C

steps:
1. Work on sub-branch
   git checkout feature/A/part-1
   ... do your testing or changes ...

2. Merge part-1 into parent feature
   git checkout feature/A
   git merge feature/A/part-1

3. Merge part-2 if needed
   git merge feature/A/part-2

4. Merge feature A into main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge feature/A
